## About me
I have been a software engineer since 2002 and have done professional projects for the retail, telecom, gaming, banking, Fintech, government, medical and health industries.
Programming languages I was fortunate to have done professional projects using: 
* [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi)
* [Java](https://www.java.com/en/)
* [Ruby \[on Rails\]](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Javascript/Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

Database wise I have:
* 🤩 PostgreSQL
* 🤩 DynamoDB
* 🤩 SQLite
* 🙂 MySQL
* 😰 Dbase

I was fortunate to start working with Agile methods back in 2006. Since then I have helped multiple businesses to go beyond the methodologies and understand the values and principles behind the Agile Manifesto.
